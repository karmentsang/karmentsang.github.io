To stay current with software and technology, Iâ€™ve decided to revisit and enhance some of the projects 
I developed during university. 
This will help me apply new skills and approaches to improve my work.


Edit: 2024-07-21

I plan to undertake a small project to redesign this website, 
focusing on enhancing its visual appeal and usability.

### Well-being Support App 
#### Group Project

This is a group assessment that was given to complete as part of class within my course.
The aim of this project is to develop a prototype that shows key elements of our application, but it does not have to be a full
working application with some elements as placeholders or simplified. 


We aimed to make this appealing to all ages and genders, 
so we conducted a little (it is not required for this project) user research and testing to ensure it meets diverse needs and preferences.

When working on this project I created wireframes to get a gist of what we want and what we would expect. Unfortunatly, those original wireframes
have been lost due to no access to my university servers. 

However, I am able to deploy a half working website as shown below.

It is quite basic and I knew that I could do better, so I made some improvements and drew up a new wireframe.
This is created using **Figma**, which is where I draw up most of my wireframes for various group projects.


Here, as shown below, is the updated wireframe.

Looking back, I believe the project would have greatly benefited from incorporating a dark mode.
Currently, the light background may strain users' eyes and cause dryness, 
which is not ideal for a wellbeing app. 
Implementing a dark mode would enhance user comfort and align better with our 
focus on promoting overall wellness.
