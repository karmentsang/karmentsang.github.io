To stay current with software and technology, I’ve decided to revisit and enhance some of the projects 
I developed during university. 
This will help me apply new skills and approaches to improve my work.

Project carried out: 2025-04-12

Tennent's is flipping the script — while we all love a bit of sunshine, our skin doesn't always agree (I wear SPF daily!). 
That's why they have launched limited-edition T-shirts designed by iconic Scottish talents, 
with 100% profits going to Melanoma UK.

My very own 3D press-on nails!

I had the absolute pleasure of joining the amazing team at John Doe to work on the Tennent's "Taps On" Campaign! 
I took on roles in videography and directing models to bring the project to life.

In-progress: 2024-07

After completing my dissertation — which focused on building a custom static site generator —
I continued to refine and expand the website beyond the scope of the original project. 


Looking ahead, I plan to undertake a smaller redesign project to enhance both the visual appeal 
and usability of this site. This includes refining the layout, improving performance, 
and making the overall experience more engaging for visitors. 
While the core of the site remains powered by the static site generator I developed during my 
honours project, these post-dissertation updates reflect my ongoing commitment to learning, 
iterating, and building better web experiences.

In our third year of university, 
we began developing browser-based applications as part of our coursework. 
One of our key projects involved working as a team to design and build a web app prototype, 
focusing on both design and functionality within the browser environment.


This project allowed us to divide tasks and contribute different features — 
from user interface design to interactive elements — using front-end technologies. 
While it wasn’t a fully functional app, it gave us valuable hands-on experience in collaborative 
development, version control, and turning concepts into working prototypes. 
It also highlighted the importance of teamwork, communication, and iterative problem-solving 
in the development process.
