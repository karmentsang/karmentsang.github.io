        <hr>
        <p>Hi, my name is Karmen! 
I am a BSc Hons Computer Science 2023 graduate from The University of Strathclyde.</p>
<p>During my time there, I found myself eagerly anticipating my 3rd year, 
particularly because of the Web and Mobile Application Development course. 
Web development has always captivated my interest, so when presented with the chance 
to delve deeper into it, I wholeheartedly embraced the opportunity. 
And as a way to document my progress and ongoing growth, I embarked on creating a blog-like website.</p>
<p>In my honest opinion, I didn't think that I would survive university, but I did. 
Graduation is on 21/06/23, scary stuff.</p>
<hr>
<p>Besides coding &#8212; my passions extend to fashion, photography, and gaming.</p>
<p>Fashion holds immense significance to me as it plays a pivotal role in shaping 
impressions and self-expression. The way we dress speaks volumes about our individuality 
and influences the perceptions of others. Photography is just as significant. 
Capturing moments and aesthetics. </p>
<p>Gaming has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. Even at the age of seven, 
I would eagerly watch my dad play Resident Evil 4 late into the night, captivated by the 
sheer excitement and enjoyment it brought - and the jump scares.</p>
<hr>
<p>I'll add some photos here to show you a glimpse of my life:</p>
