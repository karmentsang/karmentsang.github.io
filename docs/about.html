        <hr>
        <p>Hi, my name is Karmen! I am a BSc Hons Computer Science 2023 graduate from The University of Strathclyde.</p>
<p>During my time there, I was looking forward to 3rd year the most!
Why? &#8212; Web and Mobile Application Development!</p>
<p>It didn't take long for me to realize how dedicated I am to creating functional, responsive, and sleek websites.
I have always been interested in web development, so when I had the opportunity to learn, 
I was fully invested.</p>
<p>To start off, I made this blog-like website to create a space for me to log improvements as I grow. 
And why not? It's fun! Like a summer mini project, or you could say I have a lot of time on my hands...</p>
<hr>
<p>Besides coding &#8212; I also have a love for beauty, fashion and photography. You know &#8212; Girl things. 
Oh, and gaming, we can't forget about that!
With all of these combined, nothing can make me happier.</p>
<p>In my honest opinion, I didn't believe that I would survive university, but I did. Graduation is on 21/06/23, scary stuff.</p>
<p>Here's a showcase:</p>
