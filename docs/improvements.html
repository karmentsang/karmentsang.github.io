        <h3>Streamlined Image Display - Simplifying with Modals</h3>
<p>Initially, I used separate HTML files with specific image IDs to show the original image 
upon clicking. However, this method was not very efficient. In order to enhance the user experience, 
I have now implemented a modal that presents a pop-up of the original image in its actual size. 
Since the images are larger than typical screens, I have included an overflow feature 
within the modal, enabling users to scroll and explore the images in their entirety. 
This functionality allows users to view the images at their full size or even zoom in for improved visibility. </p>
<p>&#8212; This can be viewed at the <a style="color: blue; font-size: 1em;" href="album.html">gallery</a>.</p>

<h3>Enhancing Webpage Responsiveness - Optimising</h3>
<p>I faced difficulties with achieving webpage responsiveness on various screen sizes 
while working on my honors project and developing this website.
Initially, I overlooked the fact that my 1440p monitor displayed more content compared 
to others, leading me to perceive the webpage as normal on my desktop. 
However, I diligently addressed this issue through extensive testing and thorough examination. 
As a result, I have successfully enhanced the webpage's responsiveness, ensuring its 
adaptability to various screen sizes.</p>

<h3>Dark and Light Theme - Customisation</h3>
<p>I've been tackling the ability to switch between light and dark mode. 
It still hasn't been implemented due to 
CSS files overlapping. 
In the JavaScript code I used local storage to remember the user's theme
preference across page loads.</p>

<h3>Small Hiccups</h3>
<p>There's often something that catches me by surprise. 
Take, for instance, my gallery page â€“ it kind of shifted a smidge (my inner perfectionist couldn't ignore it), 
so I tried to fix it. Turns out, one of my divs ended up in the wrong spot.</p>
