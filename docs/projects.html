        <p style="font-size: xx-small;">2024-07-15</p>
        <hr>
        <p>To stay current with software and technology, Iâ€™ve decided to revisit and enhance some of the projects 
I developed during university. 
This will help me apply new skills and approaches to improve my work.</p>
<p>Edit: 2024-07-21</p>
<p>I plan to undertake a small project to redesign this website, 
focusing on enhancing its visual appeal and usability. </p>

<h3>Well-being Support App</h3>
<h4>Group Project</h4>
<p>This is a group assessment that was given to complete as part of class within my course.
The aim of this project is to develop a prototype that shows key elements of our application, but it does not have to be a full
working application with some elements as placeholders or simplified. </p>
<p>We aimed to make this appealing to all ages and genders, 
so we conducted a little (it is not required for this project) user research and testing to ensure it meets diverse needs and preferences.</p>
<p>When working on this project I created wireframes to get a gist of what we want and what we would expect. Unfortunatly, those original wireframes
have been lost due to no access to my university servers. </p>
<p>However, I am able to deploy a half working website as shown below.</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;" src="/assets/images/Wellbeing/olddesign.png" width="964"/></p>

<p>It is quite basic and I knew that I could do better, so I made some improvements and drew up a new wireframe.
This is created using <strong>Figma</strong>, which is where I draw up most of my wireframes for various group projects.</p>
<p>Here, as shown below, is the updated wireframe.</p>

<h4>Additional Features</h4>
<p>Looking back, I believe the project would have greatly benefited from incorporating a dark mode.
Currently, the light background may strain users' eyes and cause dryness, 
which is not ideal for a wellbeing app. 
Implementing a dark mode would enhance user comfort and align better with our 
focus on promoting overall wellness.</p>
